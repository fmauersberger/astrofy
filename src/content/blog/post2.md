I’ve been thinking for some time about why certain systems spiral out of control while others, under similar pressure, stabilise and mature.

Technology platforms.
Financial markets.
Media ecosystems.
Institutions. Even relationships.

They don’t fail randomly. They fail through feedback.

When systems begin to break, the cause is often described in terms of bad incentives, poor leadership, or unforeseen shocks. Those factors matter. But again and again, what determines the trajectory is something more structural: how behaviour feeds back on itself over time.

Some feedback loops reinforce momentum. Small advantages compound. Participation begets more participation. What initially looks like success accelerates into dependence and brittleness. Correction becomes harder precisely when it is most needed.

Other loops do the opposite. They introduce friction. They slow escalation. They absorb strain. Instead of amplifying pressure, they convert it into learning and adjustment. These systems don’t avoid stress—but they remain responsive to it.

Over the past months, I’ve tried to make these feedback dynamics more visible: how reinforcing loops form, why they become self-sealing, and what distinguishes systems that fracture from those that absorb strain and adapt.

The result is a short whitepaper: *[HALF–STAR: Feedback Loops of Collapse and Resilience.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5932561)*

The paper introduces the HALF–STAR framework as a diagnostic lens—a way of seeing whether a system is structured to amplify pressure until it breaks, or to remain sensitive to feedback as strain accumulates.

This is not a manifesto or a forecast. It does not argue that collapse is inevitable, nor that resilience is easy. Its aim is more modest and more practical. Many people already sense when something is accelerating too fast, or when apparent stability is masking fragility. What is often missing is a shared language for describing those patterns clearly and early—before fracture forces the lesson.

That is what this framework is meant to provide.
